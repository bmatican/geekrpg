We will be using a Model - View - Controller programming paradigm.

As such, we will have Models that represent our data and the means to 
manipulate it. 
We will have Views as the ways in which we dispaly the data.
Finally, we will have Controllers which will guide the received requests,
from the site-level, after being dispatched to the respective application, 
directly into doing the necessary actions to the data and display.

The folder structure is natural:

/controllers
  will hold application congtrollers
/models
  will hold backend database interactions
/helpers
  will hold controller hook handlers and helper functions
/views
  will hold templates for html pages or pagelets
