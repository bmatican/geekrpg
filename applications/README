We will be using a Model - View - Controller programming paradigm.

As such, we will have Models that represent our data and the means to 
manipulate it. 
We will have Views as the ways in which we dispaly the data.
Finally, we will have Controllers which will guide the received requests,
from the site-level, after being dispatched to the respective application, 
directly into doing the necessary actions to the data and display.

Also, we have added a special folder for helper functions, that can and 
should be able to be accessed throughout the respective application, 
whether in a View, Model or Controller...
